# My Coding Projects

Welcome to my GitHub Page! Here you'll find details about two of my coding projects, including a brief description, technologies used, and links to the repositories.

## Blackjack (Python): [Python-blackjack](Python-blackjack)

- **Description**: This was one of my first ever big python scripts. This is a blackjack game wherein you play against the dealer (the computer) and get to choose whether you want to hit or stand to get 21! 

- **Technologies**: I used Python's base functions to make this script. 

## Project 2: [slitherioJS](slitherioJS)

- **Description**: This is a JavaScript(p5js) code of one of my favourite games! This game features a realistic and gameplay almost like the original game with a seperate page for controls. 
- **Technologies**: I used a p5js plug-in for VSCode to make this work, with images and sounds. 

## Project 3: [Conway-Game-Of-Life](Conway-Game-Of-Life)

- **Description**: This is a JavaScript(p5js) code of a classic old school game called Conway's Game of Life. This game follows the real set of rules and achieves the final result using the real algorithim made by Conway. 
- **Technologies**: I used a p5js plug-in for VSCode to make this work.

## Project 4: [Finance-Python-Project](Finance-Python-Project)

- **Description**: This folder is a set of python scripts, an ongoing project I have started to make a stock indicator and plan on making a stock price estimator made with Python.
- **Technologies**: I have used many libraries of python like pandas,numpy,mplfinance,yfinance and matplotlib to make these scripts.
